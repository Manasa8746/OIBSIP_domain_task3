🚗 Project Title: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning.
🎯 Objective:
    To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts car prices based on key features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and selling type.
⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used:
  🔹 Programming Language: Python
  🔹 Libraries Used:
      Pandas & NumPy → Data analysis and preprocessing
      Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization
      Scikit-learn → Model building and evaluation
  🔹 Algorithms Implemented:
      Linear Regression
      Decision Tree Regressor
      Random Forest Regressor
💡 Key Highlights:
 🔹 Handled missing values and encoded categorical features (Fuel Type, Transmission, Selling Type).
 🔹 Built and compared three ML models for price prediction.
 🔹 Evaluated models using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
 🔹 Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices using a scatter plot.
 🔹 Achieved strong accuracy (R² ≈ 0.89 with Random Forest).
🔄 Workflow:
1️⃣ Load dataset using Pandas
2️⃣ Explore and clean data (missing values, encoding)
3️⃣ Split data into training & testing sets
4️⃣ Train multiple ML models
5️⃣ Evaluate and compare model performance
6️⃣ Visualize Actual vs Predicted results
🧠 Skills Gained:
 🔹 Data preprocessing and feature encoding
 🔹 Regression model implementation
 🔹 Model evaluation and error analysis
 🔹 Data visualization and ML performance comparison

📊 Output:
Model Accuracy (R² Score): ≈ 0.89 (Random Forest)
Mean Absolute Error: ≈ 0.56
Mean Squared Error: ≈ 0.78
The Random Forest model performed best in predicting car prices with high accuracy and low error.
Visualization clearly shows that predicted prices are close to the actual prices.
